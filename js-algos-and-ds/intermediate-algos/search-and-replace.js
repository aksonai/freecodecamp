/*
Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Search and Replace

Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and 
return the new sentence. First argument is the sentence to perform the search 
and replace on. Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).
Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).

Note
Preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing 
it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should 
be replaced as "Dog"
